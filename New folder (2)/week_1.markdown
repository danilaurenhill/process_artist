*Ruby Warrior*
1 -- We spent a lot of time on Ruby Warrior. Why?

By spending a lot of time on RubyWarrior we became accustomed to many of the rules and basic lingo of ruby. This game was very challenging in that it provided for you all of the necessary rules to win and advance through the levels, but it forced you to come up with the right way to set up and simplify the code.

 
2 --Do you think the game is an effective way to learn? Why or why not?

Yes, I do think that the Ruby Warrior game is an especialy effective way of learning how to code.  It teaches you how frustrating coding can be as well as rewarding, how to apply the Ruby lingo, to set up code in the right way, as well as figure out how Ruby code differs and is similar to the English language. Additioally, it teaches you how to code in a way similar to that of playing a video game, which makes it more interesting and engaging.


3 -- We said that th "instructions are easy, the algorithms was hard" What did that mean? What's the difference betweent the instructions and the algorithms?

This meant basically that although the instructions were laid bare, the actual way in which to apply them was extremely difficult to conceptualize. The instructions only give you the laws that must be used to unlock the levels of the game, it is up to you to use them correctly. Additionally, the matter of simplifying you code to make it easier to comprehend made the algorithmic part more challenging.
